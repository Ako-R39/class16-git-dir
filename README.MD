I printed my first commit log
Today 5th June - Added a calculator shell script
To run the calculator, change the permissions to executable using the command "chmod 777 calc.sh"
To execute use the command "./calc.sh
Choosing the right tool is part of effective problem-solving process
It is very important to learn how to estimate the result before doing the calculation
It is so very easy to make mistakes when punching in the numbers
